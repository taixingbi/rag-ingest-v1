PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
Saks.com — AI Infrastructure Engineer 
New York, NY • Aug 2021 – Present
Built and operated production-grade RAG infrastructure using LangChain, including document ingestion, chunking, semantic ranking, and vector store orchestration, improving grounded response accuracy by +38%.
Designed LLM-to-database access layers using LangChain SQL and tool abstractions, enabling safe, structured querying over operational data and reducing manual lookup time by 65%.
Architected multi-agent orchestration frameworks with LangGraph, enabling task-specialized agents (retrieval, reasoning, validation) and increasing end-to-end task success rate by 28%.
Implemented LLM observability and evaluation pipelines with LangSmith, including regression testing, prompt/version diffing, and pairwise model evaluation, preventing 92% of quality regressions prior to production release.
Deployed low-latency LLM inference services with online tracing, evaluation hooks, and monitoring, maintaining P95 latency under 1.5s at production scale.
Built a centralized analytics and feature data platform on Snowflake to unify multi-source operational and event data for downstream AI and ML workloads.
Applied reinforcement learning techniques (PPO, DPO, GRPO) for LLM fine-tuning, leveraging offline evaluations, human and programmatic feedback signals to optimize response quality,
Designed and operated high-throughput Kafka event pipelines to support real-time ingestion, model signals, and agent execution triggers.
Developed serverless, distributed backend services using AWS Lambda to support scalable AI workflows and data processing.
Implemented resilience patterns (timeouts, retries, exponential backoff, circuit breakers) across AI and data services, significantly improving system reliability under load.
